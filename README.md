# Indian Movies Rating Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains a predictive model for the Indian Movies Rating dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective of this project is to predict movie ratings for Indian films based on various features such as actors, directors, release year, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **CodSoft/:** Main repository directory.
- **Indian_Movies_Rating_Prediction/:** Directory containing project files.
    - **data/:** Store the dataset files.
    - **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
    - **scripts/:** Python scripts for specific tasks or utilities.
    - **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required to run the code.
    - **LICENSE:** License information for this project.
