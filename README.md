## Introduction

This repository contains a predictive model for the Titanic dataset, a classic data science project. The primary goal is to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle's "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition.

## Project Overview

- **Data Exploration:** Explore the Titanic dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Machine Learning:** Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance and choose the best one.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-world predictions (if applicable).

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `CodSoft/`: Main repository directory.
  - `Titanic_Prediction_Model/`: Directory containing project files.
    - `data/`: Store the dataset files.
    - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
    - `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks or utilities.
    - `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the code.
    - `LICENSE`: The license information for this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running notebooks)
- Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r CodSoft/Titanic_Prediction_Model/requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodSoft.git
cd CodSoft/Titanic_Prediction_Model
```

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Customize the code as needed for your analysis or model improvements.
