## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a predictive model for the Titanic dataset. The objective of this project is to predict the survival status (survived or not) of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition.

### Project Structure
