# Titanic Prediction Model

![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg/300px-RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a predictive model for the Titanic dataset. The goal of this project is to predict the survival status (survived or not) of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. This dataset is obtained from Kaggle's "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition.

### Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks or utilities.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the code.
- `LICENSE`: The license information for this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running notebooks)
- See `requirements.txt` for a list of required Python packages. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
